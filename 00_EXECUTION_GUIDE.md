## 🎯 What's In The SQL File (COMPLETE_FRESH_SETUP.sql)

### Phase 1: Extensions
✅ uuid-ossp (for generating UUIDs)
✅ pgcrypto (for encryption)

### Phase 2: Clean Slate
✅ Safely disables auth.users triggers
✅ Drops all existing policies
✅ Removes all existing tables
✅ Purges old enums

### Phase 3: Create Fresh Schema
✅ New enums: user_role (admin|author), article_status (draft|pending|published)

✅ 8 Tables:
- public.users → User accounts with roles
- public.authors → Author profiles
- public.articles → News articles
- public.categories → Article categories  
- public.tags → Article tags
- public.article_tags → Many-to-many junction
- public.media_library → Uploaded media tracking
- public.slug_history → Track slug changes for 301 redirects

✅ 12 Performance Indexes
- All key columns indexed for fast queries

### Phase 4: Create Functions
✅ handle_new_user() → Automatic user creation on signup
✅ update_updated_at_column() → Auto timestamp updates
✅ handle_slug_change() → Track slug changes

### Phase 5: Create Triggers
✅ on_auth_user_created → Creates user with role='author' when someone signs up
✅ update_*_updated_at → Keep timestamps current
✅ on_article_slug_change → Track old slugs for redirects

### Phase 6: Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
✅ Enabled on all 8 tables
✅ Enforced at database level (can't be bypassed)

### Phase 7: Create 20+ RLS Policies
✅ Articles → Published for public, own/all for authors/admins
✅ Categories → Admin only
✅ Tags → Anyone can create, admins manage
✅ Authors → All can view, own can update
✅ Users → Own records only

### Phase 8: Create Storage Bucket
✅ Media bucket for Supabase Storage

### Phase 9: Pre-populate Base Data
✅ 10 Categories (Technology, Business, Health, etc.)
✅ 15 Tags (AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, etc.)

### Phase 10: Verification
✅ Confirms all tables created
✅ Confirms RLS enabled
✅ Confirms policies created
✅ Confirms indexes created
✅ Shows success message

## 🫡 NO HARDCODED CREDENTIALS

Here's what makes this secure and flexible:

```
❌ NOT LIKE THIS:
if (email === 'admin@newsharpal.com') role = 'admin';  // Hardcoded!

✅ LIKE THIS:
1. User signs up
2. Trigger sets role = 'author'  (automatic)
3. Admin manually does: UPDATE users SET role='admin' 
4. No hardcoding anywhere!
5. Anyone can become admin
6. Super flexible
```

---

## 👥 Role-Based Access Control

### Author Role (Default)
✅ Create articles (defaults to draft)
✅ Edit own articles
✅ Submit articles for review
✅ Upload media
✅ View published articles
❌ Can't publish directly
❌ Can't manage categories
❌ Can't edit others' articles

### Admin Role (Manually Assigned)
✅ ALL author permissions
✅ Edit/delete ANY article
✅ Publish articles directly
✅ Create/edit/delete categories
✅ Manage tags
✅ Delete authors
✅ Full dashboard access
