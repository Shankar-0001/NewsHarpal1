## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Create User Accounts

First, create user accounts via the signup page:

**Go to**: `https://newsharpal.com/signup`

**Create these accounts**:

1. **Admin Account**
   - Email: `admin@newscms.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123456`
   - Name: `Admin User`
   - Role: **Admin**

2. **Author Account 1**
   - Email: `john.smith@newscms.com`
   - Password: `Author@123456`
   - Name: `John Smith`
   - Role: **Author**

3. **Author Account 2** (Optional)
   - Email: `sarah.johnson@newscms.com`
   - Password: `Author@123456`
   - Name: `Sarah Johnson`
   - Role: **Author**

---

### Step 2: Get User IDs

After creating accounts, you need to get the user IDs.

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Copy the UUID for each user

**Option B: Via SQL**
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Copy the UUIDs - you'll need them for the next step.

---

### Step 3: Verify Author Profiles Were Created

Check if author profiles were automatically created:

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name, a.user_id, u.email 
FROM public.authors a
JOIN public.users u ON a.user_id = u.id;
```

If author profiles exist, **skip to Step 5**.

If no author profiles exist, continue to Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Create Author Profiles (If Needed)

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with actual UUIDs from Step 2.

```sql
-- For admin@newscms.com
INSERT INTO public.authors (user_id, name, bio) VALUES
('YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID_HERE', 'Admin User', 'Chief Editor and Administrator of NewsCMS');

-- For john.smith@newscms.com  
INSERT INTO public.authors (user_id, name, bio) VALUES
('YOUR_JOHN_USER_ID_HERE', 'John Smith', 'Technology journalist with 10+ years of experience covering AI, startups, and innovation');

-- For sarah.johnson@newscms.com (Optional)
INSERT INTO public.authors (user_id, name, bio) VALUES
('YOUR_SARAH_USER_ID_HERE', 'Sarah Johnson', 'Senior reporter covering business, finance, and global markets');
```

---

### Step 5: Run the Seed Data SQL

Now run the main seed data file:

**Go to**: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query

**Copy and paste** the contents of: `/app/supabase/seed_data.sql`

**Click**: "Run"

This will create:
- ✅ 8 Categories (Technology, Business, Sports, etc.)
- ✅ 20 Tags (AI, Startups, Olympics, etc.)
- ✅ 8 Articles with full content
- ✅ Article-tag relationships

---

### Step 6: Verify Data Was Created

Run these verification queries:

```sql
-- Check categories
SELECT COUNT(*) as category_count FROM public.categories;
-- Should return: 8

-- Check tags
SELECT COUNT(*) as tag_count FROM public.tags;
-- Should return: 20

-- Check articles
SELECT COUNT(*) as article_count FROM public.articles;
-- Should return: 8

-- Check article status breakdown
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.articles 
GROUP BY status;
-- Should show: 5 published, 1 draft, 1 pending

-- View all articles with details
SELECT 
  a.title, 
  a.slug,
  a.status, 
  c.name as category,
  au.name as author,
  a.published_at 
FROM public.articles a 
LEFT JOIN public.categories c ON a.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN public.authors au ON a.author_id = au.id
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC;
```

```

**Solution**: 
1. Delete failed article inserts
